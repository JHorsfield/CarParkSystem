Tests

1: Normal parking progression:
  1.1   a Car comes to the Entrance, it's license plate is read.Input the car's licensePlate in the "License Plate Scanner". 
	This happens with out the driver being aware, while they are stopped they will be instructed to input a passowrd and get a 
	'Coin' from the the the coin dispencer next to them.Press the "Get Coin" button for this. Once both of these are done the 
	entrance will open and the car can enter the Carpark.Press the "New Car" button to do this.
		**Enter "license plate" into 'license plate scanner'. Enter password into 'Passcode'. Press 'Get coin'.Press 'New Car'.**

  1.2   This Car will then choose which floor to park on. The number of free spaces in each floor will be displaced at the entrance
	(as seen on the planel to the left). As the car asends/descends sensers on the ramps will record which floor it stops on
	(as seeb by the 'Current' tag) you can use the two'go up' and 'go down' buttons to choose your floor and then 'park' to park
	on a space within that floor.
		**Use 'go up floor' and 'go down floor' to get to a floor. Press 'Park' to select that floor.**

  1.3   Obviously you will leave your car here and go about your buisness, Sine our carpark's clock is tied to the current time and
	we don't want to have to wait in real time you can use the 'Time++' and 'Time--' to add and subtract time respectivly.
		**Use 'Time++' and 'Time--' to change the current time.**

  1.4	Once time has passed, using the before stated method, and you wish to leave you can pay using a 'payment machine'.
	First enter your coin(by selecting it from the list of unpaid coins on the left) then press 'Pay for stay', you will then 
	be promted to pay an amount equal to a hourly rate x the hours you've been parked(currently the hourly rate is £2 per hour).
	You can press 'Yes' or 'No', 'Yes' means you have paid somehow(This is out of scope for us hence the simple yes) and 'No'
	meaning that you cancel the payment and walk away.
		**Select coin on left panel. Press 'Pay for stay'. Then 'Yes'.**

  1.5	At this point you can leave when ever you want, by driving your car to the exit. This will once again trip the ramp scanners
	showing that your space is open. At the exit your license Plate is once again scanned you will insert your coin and you will 
	be asked for your password (the one you input at the start). To do this select the coin from the list on the left and type down
	your password, At this point press exit and the coin will be reset, your listen plate remove from the list and you and your car
	will leave.
		**Select coin on left panel. Enter password. Press 'exit'.**

2: Discounted parking
  1.1-
  1.2-
  1.3-
	
  2	You can apply a discount using a carpark afilated id card, While most id cards work from a set discount(in our case 20%) it is also
	possible for a manual discount to be input by staff.This is shown by the number box with the number inside being the % taken off your
	price. However normally you would simply insert your coin into the machine(selecting a coin from the panel to the left) and swipe your
	card(press the button with the swipe card image).
		**Select coin from panel to the left. Press swipe card button.**
  1.4-
  1.5-

3: Advanced Pay
  3	You may wish to pay before hand, the way to do this is simple. Through some method(maybe online maybe in carpark, this is out of our scope)
	input your License plate number and pay a set amount(payment is out of scope). Then when you next go to pay for a coin the machine will
	see that you have already paid and not ask for any money but will still allow you to have paid like normal.
		**Enter license plate. Press advanced Pay.**

  Can be done at any stage before part 1.4-
4: trying to park on a floor thats full
  1.1-
  1.2-

  4	If you try to park on a floor that is full then obviously in the car park it'self you will simply not be able to get in, but within the program
	if you tried that it could give you a error message and you wouldn't be able to park.
		**repeat steps 1.1 and 1.2 till a floor is full**

5: Emergency Mode
  5	Pressing the Emergency button will activate Emergency mode, This means nothing can happen till it is cancelled both in carpark and in application.
